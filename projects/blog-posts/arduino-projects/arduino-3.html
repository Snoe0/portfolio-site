            <p>
                This project was my most frustrating one yet and required some debugging, but ultimately taught me how to adapt and problem solve. The goal of the project was to create a "Love-O-Meter" that lights up a series of LEDs based on the input from a temperature sensor.<br><br>My sensor was reporting that the temperature was -25 degrees Celsius, which was causing the LEDs to not light up as expected. After some debugging and testing, I noticed that without the sensor, the lights would light up, so the lights were not the issue. I attempted different configurations for the sensor but none worked. In the end, I used a somewhat band-aid solution by adjusting the threshold in the code to account for the low reading.<br><br>I <b>swear</b> my room isn't that cold!
